The source data (nex) file is large and maintained by the University of Rochester. Ask Marc (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/schieber.aspx) for the source data accessibility. The repository will not share the data. Each folder's name indicates its function. 

- When you get the source data, you can first use `1-nexFile2nkt_data` and generate the needed structured dataset, i.e., `nkt_data` (stands for tensor with [N]euron x [Trials] x [T]timestamps) and also instantaneous subspaces.
- Next, copy the generated nkt_data into either of the rest folders and play with it.
